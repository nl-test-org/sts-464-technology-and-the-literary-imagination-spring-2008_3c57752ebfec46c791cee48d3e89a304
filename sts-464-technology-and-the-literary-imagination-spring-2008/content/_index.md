Our linked subjects are (1) the historical process by which the meaning of _technology_ has been constructed, and (2) the concurrent transformation of the environment. To explain the emergence of _technology_ as a pivotal word (and concept) in contemporary public discourse, we will examine responses — chiefly political and literary — to the development of the mechanic arts, and to the linked social, cultural, and ecological transformation of 19th- and 20th-century American society, culture, and landscape.

**Note:** In the interests of freshness and topicality we regard the STS.464 syllabus as sufficiently flexible to permit some — mostly minor — variations from year to year. One example of a different STS.464 syllabus can be found in STS.464 _Cultural History of Technology_, Spring 2005.
