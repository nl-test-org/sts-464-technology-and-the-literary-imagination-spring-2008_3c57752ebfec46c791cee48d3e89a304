Weekly Writing Assignment
-------------------------

Each week, students are to write a brief (750-1500 word) paper examining the significance of an aspect of each week's assigned reading in illuminating the ultimate emergence of the concept of "_technology_" — and its environmental impact. This paper is due (via email to the instructors and fellow students) each Monday at noon preceding a class day. Because each class meeting will be organized around issues raised in the student papers (they in effect set the agenda of class meetings), the timely submission of the papers is important.

Students are urged to consider, week by week, the usefulness of each session in clarifying the emergence and cumulative significance of technology and its impact on the environment. The weekly papers will constitute each student's running journal or diary of thoughts on the subject.

Final Paper and Oral Report
---------------------------

For their final paper, students will critically assess the validity of McKibben's argument in _The End of Nature_, in the light of the historical record as revealed by our readings and discussions. What are its strengths and weaknesses as a response to technological progress and the devastation of the environment? To what extent does it clarify the chief issues raised by our course?
